## Medical-Insurance-Dataset-Analysis
"Medical Insurance Dataset Analysis - A data analysis project on predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning algorithms. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model implementation."

# Description:
This project uses MATLAB to analyze the Medical Insurance Dataset and predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information on individuals' medical insurance costs based on various features like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation.

# Technologies Used:

MATLAB
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Data Visualization (MATLAB plotting tools)

This project uses the Medical Insurance Dataset to predict insurance costs. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualizations, and applying machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, Neural Networks etc.
